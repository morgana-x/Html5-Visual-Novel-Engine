# Html5-Visual-Novel-Engine

A bad personal visual novel framework

# Features
- scripting system (Very unnessecary but it can pass text and use some limited 'safe functions' (Doesn't really check the strings for safety though, I hate javascript!)
- that's about it!

Used [VoiceVox](https://voicevox.hiroshiba.jp/) to generate the japanese voice lines
